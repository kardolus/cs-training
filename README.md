I suggest using this list as a warm-up for interview preperation. Follow it up with interview problems from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit), [Cracking the coding interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) or [Programming Interviews Exposed](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-interviews-exposed/9781118283400/). 

It can help to practice using coderpad.io, since it is used for many coding interviews.
